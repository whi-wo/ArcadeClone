# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
a classic, fun rendition of the original, "Frogger".


## Background

This novice project is a part of a student submission in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. I converted provided files from a static project to an animated games by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It was intentional to complete this project using vanilla Javascript only.

To get started, open the `index.html` to view the existing game functionality.

## How To Play
The object of the game is to reach the river without being hitting any of the enemy bugs. Using the directional keys on a keyboard to move the player across the playing area. If you are hit, you will be placed back to the starting position. Once, you've won the game, click the Replay button to play again.

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

- Use of the font-awesome library for CSS
- MDN Web Docs for 2D collision detection
